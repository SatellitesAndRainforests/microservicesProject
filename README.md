Java 17 - records
Java Lombok - @Anotations for less boilerplate object code (constructors, getters, setters ...)
Maven multimodule - parent and inheriting child Poms (submodules can choose which dependiencs to import or force dependencies to all submodules)

microservices for business logic
easier deployment, easier team decoupling, breakdown, divide conqure, components
microservices are the new normal, small self contained ready to run applicaitons.   
see : https://spring.io/microservices for more details.
microservices can make requests to eachother

public network (client requests) --> load balancer (main entry point), routes requests to to microservice.
(spring has its own load balancer) 'usually you would not setup your own load balancer' to focus on own business logic.
same with 'databases' usually never host a database, use a database service. 

microservices have 'internal communictaions'

Kubernetes 'all the way' for taking an application to production, instead of : 
Eureka Server( manages ports), Config Server(development, testing envioment), 

Distruting tracing (tracks a requests journey), can be used to identify botlenecks.

typically 1 database per microservice
